~~ This is a Windows DOSKEYs for assesting web development.

~ These keys work with a specific directory, in my case "D:\dev" or "D:\tut" for trying new things.

*The idea behind this approach is to develop in a backUp folder, and updating the git repo along the way
without copying/uploading unnessesary files like node_modules, android or ios folder...

-The main advantage of this approach, is the flexability of trying new things, just save the working code,
and enjoy cracking new things :)

-The second advantage is it's easy to initate new project, or a small one (for learning new things),
without the need of remembeering all the words and dashes.

-Lastly it makes uploading to Git a little bit easier, with the consederation of the branch name.
